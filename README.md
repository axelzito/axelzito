  I am a software engineer with 5 years of professional experience in development, specializing in Ruby on Rails, and a total of 8 years of experience in the technology field. During this period, I have had the privilege of working on highly prominent projects, including systems in production at the Supreme Federal Court (STF) and various Courts of Justice and Courts of Audit throughout Brazil.<br><br>
  In addition, I hold a degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Goi√°s (UFG). This academic background has provided me with a solid foundation to tackle the challenges of software development, complementing my professional experience.<br><br>
  Being involved in these high-impact projects has allowed me to bring significant value to the developed products. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to take on a leadership role as a Tech Lead, guiding teams and overseeing the implementation of technological solutions.
